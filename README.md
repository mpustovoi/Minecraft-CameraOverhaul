## ‚ùó What's this?!
**CameraOverhaul** is a highly configurable clientside Minecraft mod that attempts to improve overall satisfaction of the game through the introduction of various camera rotations, emphasizing the player's movement and improving visual feedback.
Strafing and turning around will tilt the camera sideways. Jumping, falling, and moving forward or backwards will affect the camera's pitch. Nearby explosions will shake the screen, and ceasing movement for enough time will cause the camera to gently sway around while waiting for your input.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Can I turn off X and only keep Y?
You can use in-game configuration screens ([Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) if on Fabric/Quilt) to configure the mod in-game.

You can also manually edit the well-documented configuration file with intensity scaling for all features at<br/>
`.minecraft/config/cameraoverhaul.toml`.<br/>
Set any factor to `0.0` to turn its feature off.<br/>
Negative numbers are also usually legal, allowing inverting effects, if that's your thing.
